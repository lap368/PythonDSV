> Poteligeo (mogamulizumab) is an FDA-approved medication specifically for treating certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It was approved by the FDA in 2018 for adult patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) or SÃ©zary syndrome who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. 
> 
> The drug is manufactured by Kyowa Kirin and has gone through clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. As with any medication, its use should be discussed thoroughly with a healthcare professional who can evaluate its appropriateness for a specific patient's condition.
> 
> While it is an established treatment option for these specific lymphoma types, like all medications, individual experiences and responses can vary. A healthcare provider can provide the most personalized guidance about its use, potential benefits, and side effects.
