> [!answer]
> ```answer-text
> **Crysvita** is the brand name for **burosumab**, a prescription medication used to treat **X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH)** and certain other rare conditions that cause low phosphate levels in the blood.
> 
> ### What is Crysvita used for?
> - **X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH):** A rare inherited disorder that causes low phosphate levels, leading to soft, weak bones (rickets or osteomalacia), bone pain, and growth problems.
> - **Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO):** In some cases, Crysvita is used to treat adults with TIO, a rare disease caused by certain tumors that lower phosphate levels.
> 
> ### How does Crysvita work?
> Crysvita is a **monoclonal antibody** that binds to and inhibits a protein called **fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)**. FGF23 is responsible for reducing phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys and lowering vitamin D production. By blocking FGF23, Crysvita increases blood phosphate and active vitamin D levels, helping to improve bone mineralization and strength.
> 
> ### How is Crysvita given?
> Crysvita is given as a **subcutaneous (under the skin) injection**, usually every two or four weeks, depending on the patientâ€™s age and condition. Dosage and administration are determined by a healthcare professional.
> 
> ### What are common side effects?
> Some possible side effects include:
> - Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain)
> - Headache
> - Muscle pain
> - Nausea
> - Tooth abscess (especially in children)
> - Increased blood phosphate (hyperphosphatemia)
> 
> ### Important information
> Crysvita should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider experienced in treating rare bone disorders. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor phosphate and calcium levels.
>

> **In summary:**  
> Crysvita (burosumab) is a medication for certain rare diseases that cause low phosphate in the blood, helping to strengthen bones and improve symptoms.
