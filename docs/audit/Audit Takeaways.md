# Part 1. AI Messaging
## Process
We created a set of the most pressing questions patients and prescribers want to know about your drugs and the conditions they treat. We then [[AuditReport2025-10-01|asked those questions]]  to two of the most popular AI chat bots in the world, ChatGPT and Claude, and gauged how much of an advocate they were or were not for your product. 

## What we found
Overall, the story these messages spell out is that AI agents **do not know you as well as they should**. 

### Nourianz
Nourianz does not get brought up nearly enough. When asked about treating off episodes in Parkinson's, the models brought up 8 medications on average, yet only named Nourianz in one of the four scenarios, where it was named fifth out of five.  Even worse, neither model brings up Nourianz as a potential alternative to either Ongentys or Kynmobi.

### Crysvita
Crysvita is your success story. It consistently was brought up as the only way to treat XLH and TIO and was always referred to by its brand name. In two cases, the model brought up the company name, Kyowa Kirin, something we otherwise only saw when asking directly about any of the drugs by name. In another, while it was being asked about treatment for TIO, it, un-prompted, brought up that Crysvita also treats XLH. Clearly, the AI agents have an excellent understanding of Crysvita, and it offers us a look at how an AI agent being familiar with one part of your business lifts up how much they will talk about you and advocate for you.

### Potelegio
Potelegio is a mixed bag. While it does get brought up in 3 of 4 cases asking about treatment for Mycosis Fungoides, in all of them it is mentioned only very briefly. When asked about second-line treatment options for MF and for Sezary Syndrome, repeatedly we saw mogamulizumab get brought up, without any mention of Potelegio by name, despite Potelegio being the only mogamulizumab available. That corner on the market should let you get the same advantage that being the only treatment for XLH and TIO gave you with Crysvita; we would love to see Potelegio and Kyowa Kirnin get brought up every single time someone asks about second-line treatment for MF and SS.

### Overall
Kyowa is positioned very well to become a major player in GEO. You have two products which are each unique in their respective treatments, and the models seem to be "familiar with your work" but aren't yet the fangirls that we'd like them to be.
